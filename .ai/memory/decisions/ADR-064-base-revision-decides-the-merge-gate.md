# ADR-064: The base revision decides the merge gate

**Status:** Accepted | **Date:** 2026-11-14 | **Tags:** ci, testing, factory, security

## Context

The merge gate ([`scripts/checks/README.md`](../../../scripts/checks/README.md), Merge gate; [ADR-062](ADR-062-checks-run-before-merge-not-on-main.md)) decides which checks a pull request must pass. Its jobs ran the gate code and read the pin of the PR checkout. Thus a PR that changed the gate code would decide its own selection, and every change to a gate input gave a full run. A full run costs about $1.00 to $1.20, and a gated run $0.06 to $0.17. About 1 in 9 PR runs was full for this reason, and close to half on days of CI work.

The threat is a change to the gate that removes a check from the selection of its own PR: a fault, or an agent that wants its PR to pass. The gate is not a control against a hostile author. GitHub runs the `pull_request` workflow of the merge revision, so a PR can change any job of `ci.yaml`. The root package scripts also run in the manifest job. The review critics and a person are the controls for those changes.

## Decision

- **The gate code and the pin come from the base revision.** The merge revision of a PR has `main` as its first parent. The manifest, plan and Merge gate jobs run `scripts/checks/gate.mjs` and read `.github/merge-gate.json` of the first parent (`git archive` to `$RUNNER_TEMP/gate`). The select, LLM and critics jobs hold a credential, so they read only the pin of the first parent. PR Deploy reads the mode of the base too. For a PR that does not change the gate, this is the same code.
- **The mode leaves the manifest job as an output.** The base gate code decides it before any PR code runs in that job, so later PR code cannot change it.
- **A gate input that no job of the PR run executes runs the selector.** These are `merge-gate.json`, `gate.mjs`, `plan.mjs`, `shard.mjs`, `schema.mjs` and `schema/*.json`. A test checks that no other source file imports or reads them. The new pin first selects the runs after the merge. The plan runs every test of the CI scripts (`policy:tests-*`) for such a change, so the LLM stage cannot drop a test of the changed gate code. Their keys hold the changed file, so a stored pass stays a hit.
- **A check of a job-scoped `ci.yaml` change gets no PR store hit.** An earlier run of the PR can have run it with another `ci.yaml` under the same key.
- **The other gate inputs keep the full run.** `ci.yaml` outside the steps of check jobs and `.github/actions/**` run from the PR, and only a full run proves a changed job graph. A module that lists and runs a family (`projects.mjs`, `evals.mjs`, `lanes.mjs`, `storybook.mjs`) decides which checks exist in its own run. A reference listing with the base code would run in the manifest job after PR code, so the PR could change what it reads. `list.mjs`, `families.mjs`, `run.mjs`, `selected.mjs`, `rerun-failed.mjs`, `log.mjs`, `prerequisites.mjs`, `visual.mjs`, `toolchain.mjs`, the trace files, the `scripts/ci` runners and data files, `.npmrc`, `patches/` and the list-time files outside `scripts/checks/` make or run the checks of several families or change every key.

## Consequences

- A PR that changes only the gate code, the schemas or the pin gets a gated run with the tests of the CI scripts.
- A change to the interface between `plan.json` and `selected.mjs` keeps working: the base writes the plan, and `selected.mjs` is a full-run input.
- A gate change that needs its own gate to pass cannot pass in its PR. Its run uses the base gate, or it is full.
- A new pin is not tried on its own PR. When it fails after the merge, the select job fails, and the runs are full until a fix. The factory repo tests each release.
- A check of a job-scoped `ci.yaml` change runs again on each push of its PR.
